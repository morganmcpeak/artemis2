        <h1>About Artemis Search Group</h1>
         <p className="paragraph">Artemis Search Group began in the depths of the last economic recession, 2010. Our
                philosophy was then and is today, “independent of economic conditions, companies will
                always be interested in people that can move the needle.” There will always be a
                market for high-level performers. We believe that assessing professional skill-set and
                experience, based on in-depth interviewing and resume validation is merely one of the
                early steps of the hiring process. However, this step represents a significantly lower
                predictor of success within your organization than you may believe.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">We are successful again and again because we understand that often professional skill-
                    set match is not the true reason for an offer of employment. Additionally, this is almost
                    never the reason that a candidate accepts or declines an employment offer. Moreover,
                    in a management or leadership role, this skill-set match is rarely the most robust
                    indicator of a long-term successful professional relationship. We have maintained an
                    offer acceptance rate in the 97 th percentile, specifically because we understand the
                    difference between a qualified resume submission and a successful long-term hire.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Upon commencement of our partnership, we become your Opportunity Sales Agents
                        (OSA). Qualified candidates are not the product of our process. Qualified candidates
                        are the inputs to the process we sell on your behalf. We market exceptional growth-
                        oriented business opportunities to your industry's top professionals. We provide an
                        uncommonly quick, extremely cost-effective, talent acquisition process. Leading
                        ultimately to long-term employee relationships and high levels of performance.
                        Allowing incumbent leaders to focus on business objectives, rather than the dreaded
                        hiring questions:</p>
                        <p class="question">"Why is it taking so long to find someone for this job?"</p>
                        <p class="question"> "Why can't we find someone to help us get this done?"</p>
                        <p class="question">"Why are people turning down our offers?"</p>
                        <p class="question">"Why can't we keep anyone once we do find them?"</p>
                        <p class="callus">
                            We know the answers to these questions, and we deliver the solutions. Call Artemis Search Group today! (248)499-8001</p>
